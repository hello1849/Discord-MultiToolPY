## Next update:
The next update of this tool will have alot of features. I will make the mass dm less buggy and more faster, you will be able to set delays for basically everything,  the whole interface will be different. also i will add a captcha solver to solve captchas on join it is slow tho but it will work. I will add more cookie handling and the tool will cache cookies and fingerprints for later use. That will lower the chance of your token being locked. Also i will add webhook logs, the tool will send a message thru webhook with logtype and logmessage. If you got any suggestion on what i should add next dm me on guilded or discord with the suggestion and if I like it I will give you credits on the repo.
